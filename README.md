# Ultra

Hey, you know who has two thumbs and strong opinions? That's right, it's me.

Ultra is a Leiningen plugin aiming to provide an absolutely kick-ass development environment.

## Installation

Add the following to your `:user` profile:

```clojure
[venantius/ultra "0.1.4"]
```

## Features

*A colorized REPL!*

*Clearer test output!*

*Better stacktraces! In both the REPL and tests!*

*Java object introspection!*

## Configuration

```clojure
{:user {:plugins [[venantius/ultra "0.1.4"]]
        :ultra {:color-scheme :solarized_dark
                :width 80
                :print-color true}}}
```

### Color schemes

At the moment Ultra supports the following color schemes:
 - `:solarized_dark`
 - `:default`

If you want to set the colors yourself instead of using a theme you can configure them directly, e.g.:

```clojure
{:user {:plugins [[venantius/ultra "0.1.4"]]
        :ultra {:print-color true
                :color-scheme {:delimiter [:red]
                               :tag [:red]
                               :nil [:cyan]
                               :boolean [:cyan]
                               :number [:cyan]
                               :string [:cyan]
                               :character [:cyan]
                               :keyword [:green]
                               :symbol nil
                               :function-symbol [:blue]
                               :class-delimiter [:blue]
                               :class-name nil}}}}
```

## Contributing

Please open an issue here before submitting pull requests; I prefer to have documentation and consensus that either of our time will be well spent by working on it. 

Bug fixes are always appreciated and won't get too much pushback; new features will be held to a higher standard - this whole project is a massive exercise in ego, after all.

Pull Requests for new color schemes welcome; please include screenshots in your submission.

## Motivation

...or, why didn't you just put all of this stuff in your `~/.lein/profiles.clj`?

Great question, hypothetical asker! In short, my `:user` profile was starting to 
become bloated. It was difficult to tell whether plugins were interfering with 
each other to create problems, and my `:injections` key in particular was 
starting to look a little unwieldy. 

As I got further down the route of configuring my environment, I started to add
or re-write core functionality of other tools, and eventually ended up really
rummaging around in the guts of things. At some point it just made sense to split
it out into its own project.

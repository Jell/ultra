# ultra

Hey, you know who has two thumbs and strong opinions? That's right, it's me.

## Usage

Put `[ultra "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile, or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install
ultra 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

## Contributing

Please open an issue here before submitting pull requests; I prefer to have documentation and agreement that either of our time will be well spent by working on it. 

Although the above applies equally to bugfixes and feature requests, a different standard will be held for merging in PRs. In general, I won't be too fussy about bugfixes, but since this whole project is a massive exercise in ego and opinion I'm liable to be a bit more picky about new feature requests.

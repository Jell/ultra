Hey, you know who has two thumbs and strong opinions? That's right, it's me.

Ultra is a Leiningen plugin for an absolutely kick-ass development environment.

I've written a blog post describing Ultra in greater depth [here](http://blog.venanti.us/ultra).

## Installation

To install and configure Ultra, add something like the following to your `~/.lein/profiles.clj`

```clojure
{:user {:plugins [[venantius/ultra "0.1.9"]]
        :ultra {:color-scheme :solarized_dark}}}
```

### Requirements

Colorized nREPL output requires Leiningen version 2.4.2 or higher, and the plugin at large needs JDK 7+.

## Features
For a detailed list of features, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/venantius/ultra/wiki). Here's the highlight reel:

*A colorized REPL!*

*[Clearer test output](https://github.com/venantius/ultra/wiki/Tests)!*

*Better stacktraces!*

*[Java object introspection](https://github.com/venantius/ultra/wiki/Java)!*

## Configuration

All of the above features are enabled by default, but can be turned off by setting a `false` flag in your profile. If you wanted Ultra to essentially no-op, your profile would look like this: 

```clojure
{:user {:plugins [[venantius/ultra "0.1.9"]]
        :ultra {:repl         false
                :stacktraces  false
                :tests        false
                :java         false
                :quiet-lint   false}}}
```

### `:quiet-lint`?

This is a bit of an odd flag, but by way of explanation: the Java utility functions intern, amongst others, `protocol?` and `interface?` functions in `clojure.core`, which then collide (and emit warnings for) functions of the same name that exist in `eastwood.util`. By default, Ultra suppresses those warnings while it `require`s the Eastwood ns.

### Color schemes

At the moment Ultra supports the following color schemes:
 - `:solarized_dark`
 - `:default`

If you want to set the colors yourself instead of using a theme you can configure them directly, e.g.:

```clojure
{:user {:plugins [[venantius/ultra "0.1.9"]]
        :ultra {:color-scheme {:delimiter [:red]
                               :tag [:red]
                               :nil [:cyan]
                               :boolean [:cyan]
                               :number [:cyan]
                               :string [:cyan]
                               :character [:cyan]
                               :keyword [:green]
                               :symbol nil
                               :function-symbol [:blue]
                               :class-delimiter [:blue]
                               :class-name nil
                               :exception nil}}}}
```

## Contributing

Please open an issue here before submitting pull requests; I prefer to have documentation and consensus that either of our time will be well spent by working on it. 

Bug fixes and code cleanup are always appreciated and won't get too much pushback; new features will be held to a higher standard - this whole project is something of a massive exercise in ego, after all.

Pull Requests for new color schemes welcome; please include screenshots in your submission.

## Motivation

...or, why didn't you just put all of this stuff in your `~/.lein/profiles.clj`?

In short, my `:user` profile was starting to become bloated. It was difficult to tell whether plugins were interfering with each other, and my `:injections` key in particular was starting to look a little unwieldy. 

At some point I realized I was up to my neck in alligators and that it was time to push things into a standalone repository.
